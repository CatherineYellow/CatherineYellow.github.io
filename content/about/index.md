## Research Experience
**Research on Financial Simulation Optimization Algorithms (Feb. 2024 - May 2024)**  
*Research Assistant; Supervisor: Prof. Peng Yang*  
- Crafted a sophisticated high-dimensional parameter system for the simulation and representation of financial data, leveraging optimization and dynamic calibration methodologies.
- Conducted extensive literature reviews on Bayesian optimization, Neural networks replacing surrogate models, etc.
- Refined high-dimensional financial market models by optimizing parameters using advanced algorithms, including Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).
- Built comprehensive end-to-end calibration models for financial market simulations, utilizing Bayesian optimization and neural network-based surrogate models.

**Study on the Impact of Scientist Migration (Jul. 2023 - Sept. 2023)**  
*Research Assistant; Supervisor: Prof. Yifang Ma*  
- Developed a large-scale dataset with 200 million records covering over 350,000 scientists and 630,000 academic positions, spanning 19 fields mainly in medicine, chemistry, materials science, computer science, and biology.
- Analyzed the attrition rates and attraction rates of postdoctoral and faculty scientists across different countries, and mapped the global movement of scientific talents.
- Executed comparative analysis of domestic and foreign scientists over time based on innovation, citation counts, productivity, and popularity, employing t-tests for statistical significance.
- Compared national policies regarding requirements for domestic and foreign scientists based on citation counts, productivity, and Interdisciplinarity.
- Formulated log-rank test to compare the survival probabilities of scientists across genders, countries, fields over a seven-decade span.

**Distribution of Authorship Contributions in Research Papers (Jul. 2022 - Aug. 2022)**  
*Research Assistant; Supervisor: Prof. Yifang Ma*  
- Formulated quantitative evaluation metrics to access individual author contributions within research papers, enabling a systematic comparison of authorship credit.
- Implemented and refined the Collective Credit Allocation (CCA), applying this model to author credit distribution analysis in an extensive corpus (10k+) of academic literature.
